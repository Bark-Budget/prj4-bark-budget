            <p class="italic">Note: Not added to webpage itself to avoid an overload of text</p><br>
            
            <h5>Accessibility</h5>
          <p>Our brand should be accessible to all kinds of people as budgeting is relevant to a very wide scope of people. It should be possible for everyone who wants or even needs to have a dog to be able to have one, no matter the financial situation that they are in. </p> <br>
            
            <h5>Joy</h5>
            <p>At Bark Budget, we firmly believe in the phrase ‘money doesn't buy you happiness’. You don't need fancy dog toys or overpriced snacks to guarantee a better life with your dog. Having fun and sharing meaningful experiences with your dogs is of great importance to us. Joy in having a dog should never be influenced by the amount of money you have at your disposal to spend on your dog.</p> <br>
            
            <h5>Simplicity</h5>
            <p>As Bark Budget is targeted towards a large age group, it is important to give a simple experience by having an easy to navigate website. The reason our target group is visiting our website is to find information and inspiration on how to save money on their dogs, and Bark Budget is meant to make this as easy as possible.</p> <br>
            
            <h5>Creativity</h5>
            <p>Thinking outside of the box is very important in our brand. With creative thinking we offer alternatives to budgetary problems that occur to dog owners. For example, DIY tutorials on dog toys to prevent someone from having to buy a new toy every other week for their dog.</p> <br>

          </ul>
            </li>
          <li><strong>Colour choice justification</strong></li>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dark spring green (#087248)</strong> is chosen for its association with walking your dog in a park or forest, and also is the colour of a money bill.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dark orange (#FF9233)</strong> is chosen for the pop of colour, playfulness, and also has a cartoonish vibe that is reminiscent of the colour you could use when drawing a dog. </li>
                  <li>Our yellow, which is <strong>Sunglow (#FFD147)</strong>, is chosen for the pop of colour that it brings to the palette, and the way yellow is the colour of sunshine, which makes people happy just like dog owners feel about their dogs. </li>
                  <li><strong>Seal Brown (#4E2503)</strong> is chosen for the deep brown colour that reminds you of a dog’s fur, and as it's an earthy colour, is reminiscent of the outdoors where dogs love to be. </li>
                  <li>Our lighter brown, which is <strong>Buff (#DE9D68)</strong>, is also chosen for its association with the colour of a dog's fur, its earthy tone, and since it is lighter than Seal Brown, feels lighter and less intense. </li><br>
                  
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Font choices</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Title font: <strong>Chewy</strong>. This font contains organic shapes and presents itself in a playful way, which fits the tone of voice for our brand. It is also bold enough to stand out, but contains enough whitespace within and between the letters to remain legible. </li>
                <li>Header and body font: <strong>Inter</strong>. This font is specifically designed for digital screens,&nbsp; it is not overly bold or overly italic and it's consistently legible at every size due to the fact that it was designed with digital screens of different sizes in mind, and the amount of whitespace within and between the letters.</li>
              </ul>
            <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong></li>
              <ul>
                  <li>We used UI to the benefit of our audience, by using dropdown menus and tabs together to organize budgeting recommendations. Users can easily navigate to the particular tips they are looking for with the  dropdown menu, which offers a concise way to present a variety of tip categories without overwhelming them with too much information at once. By using tabs, we provide a visual and interactive way of switching between tip categories, and allow visitors to easily browse information. By offering a well-structured and intuitive navigation system, this method improves usability and makes it easier for users to receive relevant budgeting advice quickly.</li>
              </ul>
          <li><strong>Structure of the navigation and content</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>The website design fits the core four values of Bark Budget, which are accessibility, joy, simplicity, and creativity. With the design we have taken into account that the website should be as accessible as possible to everyone. It's targeted to a wide scope of people, which is evident in the language we use, the images of dogs, and how you can navigate through the website. It's easy to understand and the website clearly indicates that it is for budgeting tips for dogs.</li><br>
                  
                <li>The joy is expressed in the images of dogs that we use, which are of happy dogs. Also, dog owners love seeing dogs, which we found out about in our interviews. By using puns in some of our sections, such as ‘Our pawsome tips’, we want to put some joy and humour into our website.</li><br>
                  
                <li>As mentioned before, Bark Budget is targeted towards a large target group. Which is why the website is made to be as easy to understand as possible. The simplicity of our website is seen in the way that it's easy to navigate and the amount of text isn't overwhelming. Because of our simplicity, it is more likely for website visitors to call to action. The main wallet-friendly tips are showcased on the main page and only need a click to have access to the information. The green button on the top right clearly indicates that that is where you sign up for the website, where it is immediately explained that by doing so you will sign up for the Bark Budget newsletter, and what this entails. By giving these explanations and having everything be clear and easy to find, it's easy for almost everyone to use.</li><br>
                  
                <li>The tips, tricks, and hacks that we offer on our website are an indication of the creativity that is so important to our brand. We encourage thinking outside of the box, and with the ‘pawsome’ tips that we provide, we show that there are solutions to problems that are very creative. </li>
                  
                <li>The crux of Bark Budget's marketing campaign is that the information we provide is useful and joyful and gives the message that everyone can be able to enjoy having a dog no matter their financial situation. The language we use on the website, on top of the images, are a fun and light-hearted way of providing solutions to people who need help with budgeting for their dogs.  </li><br>
                  
                <li>In our communication strategy we want to show dog owners that it's not necessary to spend a lot of money on their dogs to have fun. Our content is also meant to be simple, fun, and it should invoke joy. With our mixture of useful tips that are brought in a playful manner, we want to invoke these emotions on website visitors and also provide them with information in a simple and fun way.</li><br>
                  
                <li>Bark Budget's unique value proposal is that it is a simple website for dog owners where all information to save money on dog products/necessities is gathered. The website is easy to navigate and has a simple design that makes it accessible to as many people as possible. It is not only a convenient website where tips and tricks for dog budgeting are gathered, but Bark Budget is also a supportive community of dog owners helping each other. The sense of community is seen in hacks and tips being inspired by other dog owners. By giving the option to sign up for the Bark Budget newsletter where you'll be the first to know about the launch of our budget-conscious dog parent forum, is in alignment with our unique value proposal which is that Burk Budget is also a community of dog owners helping each other. At Bark Budget, we want to ensure that every dog and their owner has a joyful time no matter how much you have in your bank account, which is seen in how the design of the website is playful.</li><br>

              <ul>
              <li>Test the intuitiveness of the website's navigation system.</li>
                <li>Test the consistency of design elements and branding throughout the website.</li>
                <li>Test the clarity and readability of text content across different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Test the clarity of the brand's overall.</li>
                <li>Test the usability of the sign-up form, including input validation.</li>
                  <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of content hierarchy within the website</li><br>
              </ul>
            <li><strong>Testing methods</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>2 participants with experience testing websites (in-person usability tests on both a laptop and a phone), along with input from target audience via solution interviews (with screenshots of the first website draft).</li>
                <li>Two tests were done on campus and the solution interviews took place remotely.
                <li>2 users were instructed to find grooming tips for their dog, sign up for the newsletter and view all the tips on the website. Solution interview participants were asked their opinion on the general emotions evoked by the website layout and content</li><br>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Testing results</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive results: </strong>The messaging of the website was clear to the users. The content hierarchy was logical and the content was easy to read on both a large and small screen. The color palette and picture used brought positive feelings for the users.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative results:</strong> The website did not seem very intuitive to the mobile user, however, the user did not fully feel it was due to the website itself. The design of the website was not fully consistent, as the color of certain buttons would change depending on the page the user was on. The sign-up form did not fully work the way it was supposed to, as an email window popped up, instead of the intended "Thank you" message. One interviewee found the website to feel a bit "bland".</li>
                <li><strong>Improvements:</strong>The banner picture has been changed for a higher-quality feel and to lessen the "bland" feeling described. The colors of the buttons have been adjusted. Headers were also adjusted to create more clarity about which page the user was on. Improvements that <strong>could</strong>have been made: Changing the result of the sign-up form. Having different banners for a clearer distinction between pages. Having all the budgeting tips in one place once you click "all tips". Changing the tip tab items so they change to a color on the brand's color palette instead of blue.</li>
              </ul>
