            <br>
            
            <h5>Accessibility</h5>
          <p>Our brand should be accessible to all kinds of people as budgeting is relevant to a very wide scope of people. It should be possible for everyone who wants or even needs to have a dog to be able to have one, no matter the financial situation that they are in. </p> <br>
            
            <h5>Joy</h5>
            <p>At Bark Budget, we firmly believe in the phrase ‘money doesn't buy you happiness’. You don't need fancy dog toys or overpriced snacks to guarantee a better life with your dog. Having fun and sharing meaningful experiences with your dogs is of great importance to us. Joy in having a dog should never be influenced by the amount of money you have at your disposal to spend on your dog.</p> <br>
            
            <h5>Simplicity</h5>
            <p>As Bark Budget is targeted towards a large age group, it is important to give a simple experience by having an easy to navigate website. The reason our target group is visiting our website is to find information and inspiration on how to save money on their dogs, and Bark Budget is meant to make this as easy as possible.</p> <br>
            
            <h5>Creativity</h5>
            <p>Thinking outside of the box is very important in our brand. With creative thinking we offer alternatives to budgetary problems that occur to dog owners. For example, DIY tutorials on dog toys to prevent someone from having to buy a new toy every other week for their dog.</p> <br>

          </ul>
            </li>
          <li><strong>Colour choice justification</strong></li>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dark spring green (#087248)</strong> is chosen for its association with walking your dog in a park or forest, and also is the colour of a money bill.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dark orange (#FF9233)</strong> is chosen for the pop of colour, playfulness, and also has a cartoonish vibe that is reminiscent of the colour you could use when drawing a dog. </li>
                  <li>Our yellow, which is <strong>Sunglow (#FFD147)</strong>, is chosen for the pop of colour that it brings to the palette, and the way yellow is the colour of sunshine, which makes people happy just like dog owners feel about their dogs. </li>
                  <li><strong>Seal Brown (#4E2503)</strong> is chosen for the deep brown colour that reminds you of a dog’s fur, and as it's an earthy colour, is reminiscent of the outdoors where dogs love to be. </li>
                  <li>Our lighter brown, which is <strong>Buff (#DE9D68)</strong>, is also chosen for its association with the colour of a dog's fur, its earthy tone, and since it is lighter than Seal Brown, feels lighter and less intense. </li><br>
                  
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Font choices</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Title font: <strong>Chewy</strong>. This font contains organic shapes and presents itself in a playful way, which fits the tone of voice for our brand. It is also bold enough to stand out, but contains enough whitespace within and between the letters to remain legible. </li>
                <li>Header and body font: <strong>Inter</strong>. This font is specifically designed for digital screens,&nbsp; it is not overly bold or overly italic and it's consistently legible at every size due to the fact that it was designed with digital screens of different sizes in mind, and the amount of whitespace within and between the letters.</li>
              </ul>
            <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong></li>
              <ul>
                  <li>We used UI to the benefit of our audience, by using dropdown menus and tabs together to organize budgeting recommendations. Users can easily navigate to the particular tips they are looking for with the  dropdown menu, which offers a concise way to present a variety of tip categories without overwhelming them with too much information at once. By using tabs, we provide a visual and interactive way of switching between tip categories, and allow visitors to easily browse information. By offering a well-structured and intuitive navigation system, this method improves usability and makes it easier for users to receive relevant budgeting advice quickly.</li>
              </ul>
          <li><strong>Structure of the navigation and content</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>The website design fits the core four values of Bark Budget, which are accessibility, joy, simplicity, and creativity. With the design we have taken into account that the website should be as accessible as possible to everyone. It's targeted to a wide scope of people, which is evident in the language we use, the images of dogs, and how you can navigate through the website. It's easy to understand and the website clearly indicates that it is for budgeting tips for dogs.</li><br>
                  
                <li>The joy is expressed in the images of dogs that we use, which are of happy dogs. Also, dog owners love seeing dogs, which we found out about in our interviews. By using puns in some of our sections, such as ‘Our pawsome tips’, we want to put some joy and humour into our website.</li><br>
                  
                <li>As mentioned before, Bark Budget is targeted towards a large target group. Which is why the website is made to be as easy to understand as possible. The simplicity of our website is seen in the way that it's easy to navigate and the amount of text isn't overwhelming. Because of our simplicity, it is more likely for website visitors to call to action. The main wallet-friendly tips are showcased on the main page and only need a click to have access to the information. The green button on the top right clearly indicates that that is where you sign up for the website, where it is immediately explained that by doing so you will sign up for the Bark Budget newsletter, and what this entails. By giving these explanations and having everything be clear and easy to find, it's easy for almost everyone to use.</li><br>
                  
                <li>The tips, tricks, and hacks that we offer on our website are an indication of the creativity that is so important to our brand. We encourage thinking outside of the box, and with the ‘pawsome’ tips that we provide, we show that there are solutions to problems that are very creative. </li>
                  
                <li>The crux of Bark Budget's marketing campaign is that the information we provide is useful and joyful and gives the message that everyone can be able to enjoy having a dog no matter their financial situation. The language we use on the website, on top of the images, are a fun and light-hearted way of providing solutions to people who need help with budgeting for their dogs.  </li><br>
                  
                <li>In our communication strategy we want to show dog owners that it's not necessary to spend a lot of money on their dogs to have fun. Our content is also meant to be simple, fun, and it should invoke joy. With our mixture of useful tips that are brought in a playful manner, we want to invoke these emotions on website visitors and also provide them with information in a simple and fun way.</li><br>
                  
                <li>Bark Budget's unique value proposal is that it is a simple website for dog owners where all information to save money on dog products/necessities is gathered. The website is easy to navigate and has a simple design that makes it accessible to as many people as possible. It is not only a convenient website where tips and tricks for dog budgeting are gathered, but Bark Budget is also a supportive community of dog owners helping each other. The sense of community is seen in hacks and tips being inspired by other dog owners. By giving the option to sign up for the Bark Budget newsletter where you'll be the first to know about the launch of our budget-conscious dog parent forum, is in alignment with our unique value proposal which is that Burk Budget is also a community of dog owners helping each other. At Bark Budget, we want to ensure that every dog and their owner has a joyful time no matter how much you have in your bank account, which is seen in how the design of the website is playful.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Testing methods</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>2 participants with experience testing websites (in-person usability tests on both a laptop and a phone), along with input from target audience via solution interviews (with screenshots of the first website draft).</li>
                <li>Two tests were done on campus and the solution interviews took place remotely.
                <li>2 users were instructed to find grooming tips for their dog, sign up for the newsletter and view all the tips on the website. Solution interview participants were asked their opinion on the general emotions evoked by the website layout and content</li><br>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Testing results</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive results: </strong>The messaging of the website was clear to the users. The content hierarchy was logical and the content was easy to read on both a large and small screen. The color palette and picture used brought positive feelings for the users.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative results:</strong> The website did not seem very intuitive to the mobile user, however, the user did not fully feel it was due to the website itself. The design of the website was not fully consistent, as the color of certain buttons would change depending on the page the user was on. The sign-up form did not fully work the way it was supposed to, as an email window popped up, instead of the intended "Thank you" message. One interviewee found the website to feel a bit "bland".</li>
                <li><strong>Improvements:</strong>The banner picture has been changed for a higher-quality feel and to lessen the "bland" feeling described. The colors of the buttons have been adjusted. Headers were also adjusted to create more clarity about which page the user was on. Improvements that <strong>could</strong>have been made: Changing the result of the sign-up form. Having different banners for a clearer distinction between pages. Having all the budgeting tips in one place once you click "all tips". Changing the tip tab items so they change to a color on the brand's color palette instead of blue.</li>
              </ul>

          <h5>Persona</h5>
          <p>Lana Steenhuis is a 34-year-old woman from Papendrecht, which is a dike village in Zuid-Holland that is surrounded by plenty of woods and meadows. She initially moved to Papendrecht to work as a nurse, but due to an injury in her right arm, she is unable to work at the hospital anymore. The pain she experienced daily with her arm prevented her from any work outside of her home, and due to this she received social assistance funds from the Dutch government. Not being able to work was difficult for Lana, since she felt like her job gave her a purpose. Being a nurse gave her the opportunity to work on her feet and help people who were sick. Because she could no longer do this, Lana became sad and even felt a bit lonely. Lana was a very fun and social person, but she got most of her social interactions from work since she lived by herself. Not sharing an apartment was never a problem for her when she worked long shifts at the hospital, but now that she no longer worked there, she noticed that her home felt a bit empty. Which is why she came to the conclusion that she should get a dog.</p><br>

            <p>Since she was on a budget she went to a shelter nearby. With the intention of only getting one dog, since two would double the costs for her and she was not doing very well financially, she looked for a nice dog to give her joy. The dog she connected most with was a Great Pyrenees called Sjakie, but the problem with this dog was that he was emotionally attached to his sister, Diamond, who was another Great Pyrenees from the same dog litter. Lana also instantly connected with Diamond, and even though she would have to make adjustments to her weekly budget for them, she really loved both dogs and decided to take them home.</p><br>  

            <p>Sjakie and Diamond proved to be very good additions to the family. Lana had to walk the dogs three times a day, which gave her an excuse to get out of the house and explore the parks in Papendrecht. She was always a dog person, but never exclusively looked for dog related content on her phone before getting Sjakie and Diamond. But since getting them, she showed more interest in this and mostly started following dog meme accounts on Instagram. She loved to get informed about dogs since she wanted to take good care of her pets, but mostly she loved funny and relatable content about dogs on her Instagram feed.</p><br>

            <p>The dogs were also the sweetest and funniest pets, and Lana loved them like they were her own children. In a sense they were, since Lana had to take care of them, and like children, spend money on them. Even though she felt it was worth it, she did struggle a bit with spending money on her dogs, since buying them food, different toys every other week since Diamond kept destroying all of them and paying vet bills. On her daily walks with her dogs, she met other dog owners and would ask for tips for good and cheaper food options, and where to get cheap toys. One time on Lana's daily walks, an elderly lady told her that she took branches from the woods (that were safe for her dog) home for them to play with. Lana thought this was a wonderful idea and took branches home with her. Sjakie and Diamond absolutely loved playing with the sticks, and since they cost Lana nothing, she could replace them daily for her dogs to play with. After this dog toy idea, Lana realised that it would be a life saver if she could save money on other things for her dogs. If only there was a general website where tips like the one from the elderly lady were all gathered.</p><br><br>
      
          <p>Bark Budget is a brand for dog owners in The Netherlands between the ages of 25-60 who want to might want to save money or are not able to spend a lot of money on their dogs. The marketing campaign of Bark Budget is a combination of both informational and fun and joyful content in the form of posts, stories and reels on Instagram and Facebook. The overarching message of our campaign is that everyone can be able to enjoy having a lovely dog pet no matter their financial status. The content is meant to feel relatable, heartwarming, funny, joyful, or all these elements at once. We will be analysing the success of each post, for which communication objectives were made as a guideline. These include: </p><br>
          <li><strong>Reach objectives:</strong></li>
          <ul>
          <li>We want 200 people to have seen our message in the form of story views by the end of the campaign Friday April 5.</li>
            <li>We want 250 people to have seen our message in the form of our reel views by the end of the campaign Friday April 5. </li><br>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Effect:</strong></li>
          <ul>
          <li>We want dog owners to feel included and enlightened that they do not need to spend a lot of money for their dog to have fun, expressed in the form of 20 likes and 2 shares sharing per post/story by Friday April 5.</li>
            <li>We want to create simple, fun and joyful content which is simply for them to have a fun 'breather’ in their feed, expressed in the form 20 likes and or 2 comments and/or a repost per post/reel by Friday April 5.</li><br> 
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Response:</strong></li>
          <ul>
          <li>For visits to our website, our aim is to have 50 website visits by the end of our campaign on Friday April 5. </li><br>
          </ul>
          <p>We have chosen Instagram and Facebook as our platforms we will be using to reach our target group. We chose Facebook, as about 80% of Facebook users are 25+ (Statista, 2023). Also, Facebook together with TripAdvisor are the most popular social media platforms amongst dog owners (Cosgrove, 2024). We chose Instagram as it is also a social media which stays one of the most used  platforms (together with Facebook) amongst older categories too (Jacqueline Zote, 2024). This means the reach will most easily be attained on these platforms. Furthermore, these platforms are ideal for more simple (and relatable) content. The platforms have a lot of variety of posts (such as stories, reels, posts etc.), giving a lot of freedom in creating more diverse content. On the one hand the enlightening informational content, as more than 60% of Instagram users utilise the app to do research on a brand. (Lin, n.d.). Almost 65% of Instagram users claim they use the app for funny and entertaining content, which is why this platform would also work for the more joyful and fun marketing content of the brand (Lin, n.d.).&nbsp;</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p><strong>PRJ4 Bark Budget Appendix: Marketing > StatisticsPosts</strong></p>
          <p>Our first most noticeable unsuccess of the campaign is our Bark Budget Facebook page. This can be mostly explained by our lack of knowledge on this platform, causing us to have a lot of issues with efficiently navigating on our Facebook page. Only near the end of this campaign did we see there was a possibility to change to a professional account where you have followers instead of friends, which made way more sense to the brand. We also discovered that most of our previous posts were set on private (the friends only setting). This meant we had missed out on a lot of visibility and reach because of our illiteracy on Facebook <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br>
      
          <p>Another key take away was that it was quite clear that the more informational price comparison posts did not do very well. Looking back, we could have stopped earlier with these or adjusted them more to see of that would have worked better. We were a little too hesitant to have changed earlier on, which wasn't useful for our time. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br>
      
          <p>The fun fact stories were also quite a success to existing followers. There was frequent engagement in those, often times around 2 likes per story. We did notice that it was better to have dog illustrations/photos in those stories as well. However, because we noticed that story viewers mostly consist of already existing followers, we could also add some content that is more targeted to those. By making the stories more interactive with for example polls, or Q&amp;A’s or asking followers to send in pictures of their dogs to be featured. This would create a closer connection with the more loyal followers.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br>
      
          <p>It was a surprise that the simple prompt posts with slides of dog pictures did very well, in comparison to the rest. They often got almost three times as much likes as the other Instagram posts. This was also the type of Instagram posts that would have the most engagement. They would be reposted two times, and they are the only type of posts that received comments. Accordingly, we decided to increase the number of times these are posted and replacing some of the informational posts with these.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br>
      
          <p>We first only planned on doing one reel. But after posting it, we saw it got a lot of views. Our first reel got more than 700 views, making it our most successful post. We then adjusted the schedule so that we would have at least one reel a week. This is the main reason how we reached over a thousand accounts on Instagram. Reels have therefore proven to be very useful in the awareness phase of the campaign.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br>
      
          <p>It was very difficult to get people to follow our account or even see our posts or account out of nowhere, which is why it felt like we were a little stuck in the awareness phase. This caused us to neglect the followers that we had gotten on our accoun	t and we didn’t busy ourselves with new content for these followers. Then we will only be creating reels to further awareness for our brand. Also the whole objective of measuring the website clicks did not work out. We did not consider that the website would only be finished on the April 5. This means the link was only available on on April 5 which was definitely not enough time to reach the 50 clicks.</p><br>
      
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we would continue, we would delve more into how to use Facebook better and more efficiently. Also providing content there which are more specific to that target group, maybe try to make use of different Facebook groups as well.</p>
          <p>Also interacting more with other dog accounts on both Instagram and Facebook could benefit the visibility of our account by having cross viewers.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the suggestions mentioned in the learning points. Continuing with the stories; fun facts as well as more interactive elements for the more loyal followers. This means including more polls, Q&As, sending in pictures and the use of DM. </p>
      
          <p>For the posts continue using the personal pictures of dog’s people like the happy and funny aspect of those on their feed. These could be connected to stories we post on the same platform. We can have a part of the campaign be posts of funny pictures of dogs that followers can send in themselves. Dog owners respond well to fun or cute pictures of other dogs as well as their own.</p>
      
          <p>However, when putting more effort into the emotional and loyalty of existing followers we must not forget to still be busy creating awareness for our brand, as we want to keep growing to reach the previous objectives. This visibility can be reached by moving away from the more budgeting/informational static content and instead posting more funny reels of dogs while still touching upon the topic of dog related budgeting. </p>
      
      
          <p>In these reels and stories, we can instead clearly refer to the website to find the actual budgeting tips instead of already giving some away on the social media.</p>
      
          <p>Ultimately the objective on the amount of website clicks can be continued. Now that the link is there and on the social media, we can make content tailored to CAT, so the response objective will be reached. </p><br>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Explanation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p><strong>PRJ4 Bark Budget Appendix: Management &gt; Lean canvases, Interview audios, Interview transcriptions</strong></p><br>
      
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
            <p>The problems we are solving with are website are derived from our initial interviews, where almost all dog owners at least mentioned one of the main problems we mentioned (highlighted in the transcriptions). In one interview, the interviewee expresses that his dogs go the vet often which is expensive. In another the interviewee said that the vet is expensive, but also food is quite expensive as well. In our interviews, there was also expressed that dog owners love connecting with other dog owners and want this to be possible. There was also enough concern expressed for the health of our interviewees dogs that we concluded that it was part of a bigger problem. </p><br>
      
            <p>The problems are currently solved inefficiently or take a lot of effort. Our website ensures that dog owners will no longer have to go through many different sites, and instead they can easily navigate through our website and can find all this information in one place. It is also easier for dog owners to connect with each other. They no longer need to find and visit a dog park because of the forum on our site, where dog owners can help each other out with tips and tricks or create friendships.  </p><br>
      
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>In the initial interviews we asked how they were currently solving the problems. After that we sat together and brainstormed how to solve this issue more efficiently and all in one place. During the solution interview many dog owners were impressed at how these problems were conveniently solved by just one website.</p><br>
          
            <p><strong>Customer Segments:</strong></p>
            <p>Based on the dog owners we interviewed and who they would recommend having a dog. We divided those people in different categories who both have/want a dog but still have to watch their spending. </p><br>
      
            <p><strong>Unique Value Proposition:</strong></p>
            <p>The unique value proposition was assembled by statements in solution interviews. Words that kept repeating throughout these interviews were that the website (and social media posts) are joyful and feelgood but at the same time very clear and convenient. </p><br>
      
            
            <p><strong>Unfair Advantages</strong></p>
            <p>Those are based of character traits of our team which we found to be very useful, or others who pointed out that those were useful.</p><br>

      
            <p><strong>Channels</strong></p>
            <p>Instagram, Facebook and the Bark Budget website are the only platforms through which the brand communicates. The social media platforms have been selected by researching which social media platforms are most compatible with our target group, this can be found in the marketing section. </p><br>
      
      
            <p><strong>Key Metrics</strong></p>
            <p>As we do not have access to other analytical software, we’ll be using the Instagram and Facebook insights to study which content on social media does well and which changes have what effect. Looking at specifically the number of likes, comments, shares, reposts etc.  </p><br>
      
      
            <p><strong>Revenue Structure</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Partnership</strong></p>
            <p>Our partnership with Lidl will be to sell budget friendly and healthy snacks that are for both dogs and their owners to safely enjoy.  

            The snacks will be sold in Lidl stores, and Lidl will pay Bark Budget €6.000 for the partnership, and Bark Budget is explicitly mentioned on the packaging. The payment from Lidl is by credit, they will be paying us once a month for the entire year.  

            The product and Lidl will be promoted on Bark Budget during the partnership. </p>
      
      
            <p><strong>Paid Advertisements</strong></p>
            <p>Besides the partnership, Lidl also wants to pay us for advertising. Other brands and companies that want to advertise are zooplus.nl and Kringloopwinkel Rotterdam. 

            Lidl will pay €5.000, Zooplus.nl will pay €6.000, and Kringloopwinkel Rotterdam will pay €6.000 for their advertisements to be shown on our website for the entire year. All three will pay us per month. All three of the companies fit with the needs of our target group, and they are paying per result of their advertisements (Bark Budget visitors going to their websites/stores). </p>
